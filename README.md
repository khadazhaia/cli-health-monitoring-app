# CLI Health Monitoring App - Challenging Version
You are a software developer at of a Taiwan-based wearable health-tech firm called Seng-Links. For your next project, you will assist in the creation of an application which will ingest 8 hours of user inputted heart-rate data and rate their quality of sleep. As the final project will take many months of hardware and software development, you are tasked with solely designing a simple command-line application which developers can use to prototype to product.

Your manager has completed the framework of this project, along with pertinent instructions, but now relies on your Python knowledge and documentation-reading skills to complete the rest.

Instructions

Access the main.py folder and implement the described lines of code. As this is the challenging version of the project, we will not list what each line of code should do; instead, we will describe the overall functionality of this project.

You, therefore, have flexibility in how you will implement this project. However, we will ask that you implement the specific contents that we describe in the main.py file (such as the for-loop, list, etc).

Submission

The due date for this project is 11/22.

To begin work on this project, you will fork this project and work on your version.

To submit this project, you will submit a link to a completed version of this Replit file to Canvas.

Note: Make sure that your project is public before sharing!
